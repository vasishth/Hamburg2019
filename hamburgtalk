30.10.2019 Klaus Fiedler (Heidelberg) What can (not) be expected of replication research

Klaus provided some interesting ideas on the Ioannidis position: If replicability research is stressed too much, it could make it difficult to detect new things (the old issue of type 1 and type 2 error. His point is to start with good theories and then trying to find converging evidence for the theory, not for a specific effect found under ceteris paribus conditions in one experiment;

04.12.2019 Tom Hardwicke (Berlin) Calibrating the scientific ecosystem through meta-research:

Tom is a collaborator of Ioannidis, therefore I guess he will explain this position. He currently works at Meta-Research Innovation Center Berlin (https://metricberlin.netlify.com/#about).


18.12.2019 Shravan Vasishth (Potsdam) The role of replication in Bayesian data analysis


08.01.2020 Rolf Ulrich (Tübingen) "Failure to replicate scientific results:  Rethinking the causes of low replication rates.

Rolf makes an attempt to tackle the problem of replication bias by estimating true effect sizes; see his paper Ulrich, Rolf, Jeff Miller, and Edgar Erdfelder. “Effect Size Estimation From t -Statistics in the Presence of Publication Bias.” Zeitschrift für Psychologie 226, no. 1 (2018): 56–80.

The audience is is mixture of staff members and master students. Most of them are not experts in statistics!!
